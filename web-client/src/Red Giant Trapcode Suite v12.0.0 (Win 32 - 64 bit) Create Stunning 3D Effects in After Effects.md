One of the most popular tools in Trapcode Suite is Particular, which lets you create realistic 3D particle systems with a variety of options and presets. You can use Particular to create fire, smoke, water, snow, sparks, bubbles, dust, and more. You can also customize the particle shape, size, color, opacity, rotation, velocity, and lifespan. You can also use multiple emitters to create complex effects and control them with physics and behaviors. For example, you can use flocking/swarming and predator/prey behaviors to simulate natural phenomena, or use bounce and air physics to add realism to your animations. You can also use fluid dynamics to create organic liquid simulations where particles interact with each other and their environment.
 
Another powerful tool in Trapcode Suite is Form, which lets you create 3D particle grids that can morph into any shape or form. You can use Form to create stunning motion graphics and abstract visuals with ease. You can also use Form to create audio-reactive animations that respond to any sound source. You can control the particle grid with various parameters such as fractal fields, displacement maps, layer maps, audio spectrum, and more. You can also use sprites and polygons to customize the particle shape and texture. You can also use the new collection of Atomic Age sprites for Particular and Form to create retro-futuristic effects.
 
A third tool that you should try out in Trapcode Suite is Mir, which lets you create 3D meshes that react to sound, are shaded with beautiful textures, and have organic movement. You can use Mir to create terrains, tunnels, landscapes, ribbons, and more. You can also use Mir to create looping backgrounds and motion graphics with minimal keyframes. You can control the mesh with various parameters such as geometry, repeaters, fractals, noise, shaders, and fog. You can also use multiple instances of Mir to create complex scenes and layer them with other effects.
