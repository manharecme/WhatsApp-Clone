## Tips for Playing Agrarian Skies 2
 
Agrarian Skies 2 can be quite challenging and overwhelming at first, especially if you are new to modded Minecraft. Here are some tips to help you get started and progress through the modpack:

- Read the quest book carefully and follow its instructions. It will teach you the basics of the modpack and give you useful rewards.
