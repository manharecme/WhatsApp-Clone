## What is a Torrent File?

To download the actual files, you need a torrent client, which is a software that can read the torrent file and connect you to other users who have the same file or parts of it. These users are called peers, and they form a network called a swarm. The torrent client downloads the files from the peers in small pieces and reassembles them on your computer.
 
The advantage of using torrents is that they can speed up the download process by splitting the files into smaller chunks and distributing them among multiple peers. This way, you don't have to rely on a single server or source that might be slow or unreliable. You can also resume your download if it gets interrupted or paused.
