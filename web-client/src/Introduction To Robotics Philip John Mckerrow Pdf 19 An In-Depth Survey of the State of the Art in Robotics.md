# Introduction To Robotics by Phillip John McKerrow: A Review
 
Introduction To Robotics by Phillip John McKerrow is a comprehensive textbook that covers the fundamentals of robotics, including kinematics, dynamics, control, sensors, and applications. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers and practitioners who want to learn more about the field of robotics.
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts and terminology of robotics, such as coordinate frames, transformations, degrees of freedom, and robot configurations. Part II deals with the kinematics and dynamics of robot manipulators, including forward and inverse kinematics, Jacobians, statics, and Lagrangian formulation. Part III focuses on the control of robot manipulators, covering topics such as feedback control, trajectory planning, force control, and adaptive control. Part IV explores the sensors and applications of robotics, such as vision, sonar, laser range finders, obstacle avoidance, navigation, grasping, and manipulation.

The book is well-written and organized, with clear explanations, examples, exercises, and references. The book also provides MATLAB code for some of the algorithms and simulations discussed in the text. The book is suitable for both self-study and classroom use.
 
Introduction To Robotics by Phillip John McKerrow is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the theory and practice of robotics. The book covers a wide range of topics in a rigorous and accessible manner. The book is available in PDF format from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^].
  
The book is not only informative, but also engaging and thought-provoking. The authors discuss the ethical, social, and political implications of AI, such as its impact on human dignity, democracy, and security. They also offer some recommendations for how to ensure that AI serves the common good and respects human values. The book is a timely and important contribution to the public debate on AI and its future.

However, the book is not without its flaws. Some readers may find the book too technical or too abstract at times, especially when it comes to the mathematical and philosophical aspects of AI. Some of the examples and case studies are also outdated or superficial, and do not reflect the latest developments and innovations in the field. The book could have benefited from more diversity and inclusivity in its perspectives and sources, as well as more attention to the challenges and opportunities of AI in developing countries.
 
Overall, Introduction To Robotics by Phillip John McKerrow is a valuable and comprehensive book that covers a lot of ground in the field of robotics. It is a good introduction for students and beginners, as well as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners. It is also a stimulating and insightful read for anyone who is interested in the history, present, and future of AI and robotics.
