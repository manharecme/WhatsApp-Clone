# How to Change the Language of Far Cry 3 to English
 
Far Cry 3 is a popular action-adventure game that was released in 2012 by Ubisoft. The game is set on a tropical island where the player has to survive against pirates, wild animals, and a mysterious cult. The game features a rich and immersive world with stunning graphics and sound effects.
 
However, some players may have trouble enjoying the game if they do not understand the language of the dialogues and subtitles. Far Cry 3 supports several languages, but not all of them have full voice-over and text localization. For example, some versions of the game may have Russian or Spanish audio, but only English text.

If you want to change the language of Far Cry 3 to English, you have a few options depending on how you obtained the game and what platform you are playing on. Here are some possible solutions:
 
- If you bought the game from Steam or Uplay, you can change the language settings from the launcher or the game properties. Simply right-click on the game in your library, select Properties, and then choose Language. You can select English or any other available language from the drop-down menu.
- If you downloaded the game from another source or have a pirated version, you may need to download an English language pack or patch. You can find these files online from various websites, such as [Gamepressure](https://www.gamepressure.com/download.asp?ID=60894) [^1^] or [Tealfeed](https://tealfeed.com/far-cry-3-english-language-pack-7hgd9) [^3^]. However, be careful when downloading files from unknown sources, as they may contain viruses or malware. You should also backup your game files before applying any patches or mods.
- If you have an .epub file of Far Cry 3 English Language Pack, you can use an e-book reader or converter to open it and extract the audio and text files. An .epub file is a digital book format that can contain text, images, audio, and video. You can use a free online tool like [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/convert/epub-to-zip/) to convert your .epub file to a .zip file, which you can then unzip and access the contents. You may need to rename some of the files to match the original ones in your game folder.

Once you have the English language files, you need to copy them to your game folder and replace the existing ones. The default location of your game folder may vary depending on your platform and installation method, but it is usually something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\FarCry3\data\_win32\. You may need to edit some configuration files as well, such as GamerProfile.xml or sound.dat.
 
After changing the language files, you should be able to launch the game and enjoy it in English. However, some users have reported that changing the language may cause some glitches or bugs in the game, such as missing dialogues or subtitles. If you encounter any problems, you may need to reinstall the game or restore your original files.
