## Use the Live Preview Feature
 
One of the best features of Visual Novel Maker is the Live Preview feature, which allows you to see how your game looks and plays in real time. You can test your animations, transitions, effects, and interactions without having to compile or export your game. This can save you a lot of time and hassle, as well as help you spot any errors or bugs in your code. To use the Live Preview feature, simply click on the Play button on the top right corner of the editor.
 
## Customize Your Live2D Models
 
While the official Live2D models are great, you might want to customize them to suit your game's style and theme. You can do this by using the Live2D Editor, which is a separate software that you can download from the Live2D website. With the Live2D Editor, you can edit the textures, parameters, motions, expressions, and physics of your models. You can also import your own drawings and turn them into Live2D models. Just make sure to follow the guidelines and specifications for creating and exporting Live2D models for Visual Novel Maker.

## Add Voice Sync Support
 
If you want to make your characters more lively and realistic, you can add voice sync support to your Live2D models. This means that your models will move their mouths and blink their eyes according to the voice files that you assign to them. To do this, you need to use a tool called Cubism SDK for Unity, which is also available from the Live2D website. With this tool, you can generate voice sync data from your voice files and import them into Visual Novel Maker. You can then use the voice sync commands in your code to make your models talk and emote.
