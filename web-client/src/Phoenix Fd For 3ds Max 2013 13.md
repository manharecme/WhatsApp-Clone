## Features and Benefits of Phoenix FD for 3ds Max 2013 13
 
- Phoenix FD is an all-in-one solution for fluid dynamics. You can simulate any type of physically-based fluid effect with fast, flexible controls for rendering, retiming and refining simulations.
- Phoenix FD is artist-friendly. You can create dynamic effects using quick presets, fast setup and intuitive controls. You can also preview and render interactively in the viewport, and adjust simulations on the fly.
- Phoenix FD is compatible with top industry tools. You can export and import fluid data using Alembic, Krakatoa, Stoke MX and OpenVDB formats. You can also use Phoenix FD with other plugins such as Forest Pack, RailClone and Ornatrix.
- Phoenix FD is optimized for V-Ray. You can render your fluid simulations with photorealistic quality and speed using V-Ray's lighting, shading and rendering tools. You can also use V-Ray's motion blur, depth of field, volumetric fog and atmospheric effects with Phoenix FD.
- Phoenix FD is constantly updated. The latest version of Phoenix FD for 3ds Max 2013 13 (build 3.13.00) was released on March 27, 2019. It added support for 3ds Max 2020, improved the FLIP liquid solver performance, added fire opacity texture control, and more.

## How to Use Phoenix FD for 3ds Max 2013 13
 
To use Phoenix FD for 3ds Max 2013 13, you need to install the plugin and activate it with a license. You can download the plugin from the official website[^1^], or from other sources[^2^]. You can also request a free trial license or purchase a full license from the website.
 
Once you have installed and activated Phoenix FD for 3ds Max 2013 13, you can start creating fluid simulations using the following steps:

1. Create a Phoenix FD Simulator object in your scene. This is the container for your fluid simulation. You can adjust its size, resolution, adaptive grid and simulation mode (fire/smoke or liquid).
2. Create one or more Phoenix FD Source objects in your scene. These are the emitters of your fluid simulation. You can adjust their position, shape, velocity, temperature, color and other properties.
3. Create one or more Phoenix FD Force objects in your scene. These are the modifiers of your fluid simulation. You can adjust their type (gravity, wind, drag, vortex), strength, direction and other properties.
4. Create one or more Phoenix FD Mesh objects in your scene. These are the meshes generated from your fluid simulation. You can adjust their quality, smoothing, displacement and other properties.
5. Create one or more Phoenix FD Ocean objects in your scene. These are the ocean surfaces generated from your fluid simulation. You can adjust their size, resolution, spectrum, foam and other properties.
6. Create one or more Phoenix FD Particle Shader objects in your scene. These are the shaders applied to your fluid particles. You can adjust their color, opacity, glow and other properties.
7. Create one or more V-Ray lights in your scene. These are the lights that illuminate your fluid simulation. You can adjust their type (sun/sky, dome), intensity, color and other properties.
8. Create a V-Ray camera in your scene. This is the camera that captures your fluid simulation. You can adjust its position, angle, focal length and other properties.
9. Set up your render settings in V-Ray. You can adjust the image size, quality, output format and other properties.
10. Simulate and render your fluid simulation using Phoenix FD's toolbar buttons or menu commands.
