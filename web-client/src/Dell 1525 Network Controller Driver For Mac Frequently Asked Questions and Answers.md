1. Visit the Dell support website[^1^] and enter your service tag or model number to identify your laptop.
2. Select Drivers & Downloads and filter by Operating System to find the drivers for Mac OS.
3. Look for the network controller driver that matches your device and download it to your Mac.
4. Double-click the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install the driver.
5. Restart your laptop and check if your network connection works properly.

If you cannot find a network controller driver for Mac OS on the Dell website, you may need to use a third-party driver that is compatible with your device. One possible option is the Realtek Ethernet Controller Driver[^3^], which supports some Dell laptops with Realtek network cards. You can download it from the Dell website and install it following the same steps as above.
 
Another option is to use a generic network controller driver that works with most devices. You can find one on the Apple website under Downloads.

Install it on your laptop and restart it. Your network controller should work automatically after that.
