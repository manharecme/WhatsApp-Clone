HDD Regenerator 2011 can be used as a bootable CD or DVD, or as a Windows application. The bootable version can work with any operating system, while the Windows version can only work with Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10. The bootable version is recommended for repairing system partitions or disks that cannot be accessed by Windows.
 
To use HDD Regenerator 2011, you need to download the program from the official website[^1^] or from an online archive[^2^]. The program is compressed in a RAR file, which requires a software like WinRAR to extract it. After extracting the file, you will get an ISO image file that you can burn to a CD or DVD using a software like ImgBurn.
 
Once you have the bootable CD or DVD, you can insert it into your computer and restart it. You will see a menu with several options to choose from. You can select "Scan and Repair" to start the scanning and repairing process, or "Scan Only" to just scan the disk without repairing. You can also select "Prescan Mode" to check if your disk has bad sectors before scanning and repairing.
 
If you choose to scan and repair, you will be asked to enter a serial number to activate the program. You can find a serial number online by searching for "Hdd Regenerator 2011 Serial Number Rar" on Google or other search engines. One possible serial number is[^3^]:
 `000017-D5KJKA-N8YPR3-DYX34X-272KJB-JVU5A4-R2Z0WW-YJZE91-BCZEG2-FH83NG` 
After entering the serial number, you will see a progress bar showing the percentage of completion and the number of bad sectors found and repaired. The process may take several hours depending on the size and condition of your disk. When the process is finished, you will see a message saying "Done". You can then remove the CD or DVD and restart your computer normally.
