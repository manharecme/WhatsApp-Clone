# How to Activate Tableau Desktop with a Product Key
 
Tableau Desktop is a powerful data visualization and analysis software that helps you create interactive dashboards and reports. To use Tableau Desktop, you need to activate it with a product key that you can obtain from the Tableau Customer Portal or from your administrator. In this article, we will show you how to activate Tableau Desktop with a product key in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Install Tableau Desktop
 
Before you can activate Tableau Desktop, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of Tableau Desktop from the [Tableau website](https://www.tableau.com/support/activation). Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process.

## Step 2: Launch Tableau Desktop
 
After installing Tableau Desktop, launch it by double-clicking on the Tableau icon on your desktop or in your Start menu. You will see a welcome screen that gives you several options to start using Tableau.
 
## Step 3: Select "Activate with a product key"
 
On the welcome screen, select "Activate with a product key". This will open a dialog box where you can enter your product key. A product key is a code that consists of letters and numbers, such as XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. You can find your product key in the Tableau Customer Portal or from your administrator. If you have a creator license, the same key activates both Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder[^1^].
 
## Step 4: Enter your product key and click "Activate"
 
In the dialog box, enter your product key and click "Activate". Tableau will verify your product key and activate your license. You will see a confirmation message that says "Activation successful". You can now start using Tableau Desktop.
 
## Step 5: Register your product (optional)
 
After activating your license, you can optionally register your product with Tableau. This will allow you to receive updates, support, and other benefits from Tableau. To register your product, click "Register now" on the confirmation message or select Help > Manage Product Keys and then click Register. Fill out the registration form and click Submit.

### Benefits of activating and registering your product
 
Activating and registering your product with Tableau has several benefits. By activating your product, you can use all the features and functionality of Tableau Desktop without any limitations. You can also access the Tableau Customer Portal, where you can manage your licenses, download products, and view your account information. By registering your product, you can receive updates, support, and other benefits from Tableau. You can also join the Tableau Community, where you can connect with other Tableau users, share your insights, and learn from experts.
 
### Alternative ways to activate your product
 
If you do not have a product key or if you are using Tableau Server with login-based license management, you can activate your product by signing in to a server. Login-based license management helps to manage licensing for users with Creator roles on Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud by eliminating the need for separate Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder product keys. To activate your product by signing in to a server, select "Sign in to a server" on the welcome screen and enter the server URL and your credentials.
